## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a project for a company that was looking to help driver's pass the DMV driving exam and road test. The company wanted us to create a website by which the customer could login and purchase one of 3 packages. Once the package was purchased, then the company wanted the customer to be able to sign up for in person driving lessons through the website. The customer could also sign up for in person classes, online classes and online tests.

## What did you do particularly well?
I believe that I captured the business requirements very well and used that knowledge to create useful UML Diagrams to convey the functionality of the system.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I believe I could have delved a little more deeply into the serverless cloud platform that would be best to host this web application. I would research the available platforms more intently.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I beilieve I interpreted the user's needs very well into my system design and captured the funcionality they desired. It is of the utmost imporatance to consider the user's needs when designing, otherwise they will not like the final product and it will either have to be redesigned or they will go with another company to create the design they want.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
First and foremost is understanding the needs and desires of the customer. Without this, the design is meaningless. Once the client's needs are determined, then it is wise to create a business requirements document and UML designs to present to the customer to make sure that your vision of the software needed to meet their needs matches the vision that they desire from the software. Once an agreemeent is made on this, then the software development can begin.
